# StackOverflow Analysis

## Installation
This is a notebook that doesn't require running to view, but if you ever wanted to run make sure you use python 3 and have:
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* pandas
* numpy


## Project Motivation
This project is the first project in the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree, where we are required to apply the CRISP-DM process to dataset.

I chose the StackOverflow data as I wanted to ask a couple of questions that bothered me personally, and they are:
* How are developers with no CS background represented in the job market? 
* What non degree education (online courses, bootcamps, etc..) do data scientists focus on?
* Is salary the reason of job dissatisfaction or are there other reasons?
